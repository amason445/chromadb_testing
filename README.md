# ChromaDB - Test Script

I wrote a test script that takes synthetic data from Python's Faker library[1], pairs it with embeddings with OpenAi's embeddings model, and adds it to a ChromaDB Database[2]. ChromaDB is an open source data base used for Retrieval Augmented Generation with LLMs[3]. The repo contains a full record from each addition as a JSON document.
